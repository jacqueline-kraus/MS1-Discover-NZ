## User stories
### As a business owner:
- I want to give clear information and recommendation to potential New Zealand travellers
- I want to provide a clear, easy understandable website, that leads the User through
- I want to be the website to look at when needing information and recommendation for travelling to New Zealand in a short time span

### As a new customer:
- I want to find information about travelling through New Zealand in a short amount of time
- I want to know which route is the best and most time saving to take
- I want to know what I have to see and what things I can leave out in my trip
- I want to know recommendations on where I can sleep
- I want to be able to ask the website owner questions about their experience

# Structure of the website

The website is optimised for all devices (desktop, mobile and tablet). It is supposed to be user friendly and easy to understand. There are small differences on some pages between mobile and desktop, to have a better visualisation of the content, based on the device. With hover effects and a lot of links (which redirects to websites with more information) the user gets some interaction. By not only having a navigation bar on top of the page, but also having a call to action on every pages body bottom (which leads to the following page), the user has two ways to read through the website.

# Wireframes
Wireframes can be found here: LINK WIREFRAMES
Note: the original wireframes changed while developing the project, so some pages look very different than initially intended.

# Surface
## Fonts
The 2 fonts that were used are Montserrat and Raleway (by Google Fonts).
Montserrat is mainly used for headlines and the Logo, Raleway is mainly used for texts that are not headlines (there may be exeptions). As a backup I used in both fonts "sans-serif"

## Colors
To have a harmonic visual impression of the website and to be aligned with the colors shown in the images, I used mainly following colors:
- Body background color: #ededed
- Text color: #464646
- Background color header and footer: #f9f9f9

## Images
- All images on the website are originally taken by me. Commercial use of the images are not allowed.
- Image backup-color: black

# Features
The website consists of 7 pages. All pages are accessible by a navigation bar in the header. A different way of navigating page by page (starting with the Homepage) are the CTAs (call to action) at the bottom of the pages (except of contact page, as it is the last page you can navigate to).
## Existing Features
### Navigation Bar (in the Header):
-  Visible on all pages
- Responsive (adapts to burger menu on mobile)

- used as an option to navigate through the website (page by page)

### Footer:

### Home (index.html):

- text with general information about New Zealand

## Features left to implement:
- embed google maps in the route page: I used a screenshot from Google maps and linked it to a preselected route. Ideally this map would be directly embedded with Google maps. The reason I didn't do it, is that Google changed their requirements of using their Google Maps API.
